    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>
      FromSoftware, Inc. is a Japanese video game development and publishing
      company. It was founded by Naotoshi Zin in Tokyo on November 1, 1986.
      Initially a developer of business software, the company released their
      first video game, King's Field, for the PlayStation in 1994. Its success
      shifted FromSoftware to focus fully on games, with them producing two more
      King's Field games before creating the mecha combat series Armored Core
      (1997), one of their flagship franchises. By the 2000s, FromSoftware's
      releases included the Echo Night, Shadow Tower, Lost Kingdoms, Otogi, and
      Another Century's Episode series. The company achieved breakout success in
      the 2010s with Demon's Souls (2009) and Dark Souls (2011), the latter
      being the first entry in a trilogy whose success led to the creation of a
      subgenre of action role-playing games known as Soulslikes. These include
      FromSoftware's Bloodborne (2015), Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (2019), and
      Elden Ring (2022), which are often cited as among the greatest video games
      of all time. Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator of the Dark Souls series, has
      served as FromSoftware's representative director and president since 2014,
      with Zin remaining as an advisor. Miyazaki directs and designs the
      majority of the company's games in addition to his executive duties.
      FromSoftware is owned primarily by Kadokawa Corporation, with minority
      stakes by Tencent subsidiary Sixjoy Hong Kong and Sony Interactive
      Entertainment. FromSoftware usually self-publishes in Japan and partners
      with companies such as Agetec, Sony, and Bandai Namco Entertainment to
      publish internationally.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      FromSoftware was founded in Tokyo by Naotoshi Zin on November 1, 1986, as
      a developer of business applications. The company released its first
      game, King's Field, for the PlayStation in 1994. Despite its commercial
      success in Japan, the game was not released in other regions, although
      1995's King's Field II was released in both North America and Europe in
      1996. After releasing King's Field III in 1996, FromSoftware went on to
      release the horror game Echo Night and the 1998 role-playing game Shadow
      Tower. In 1997, FromSoftware released Armored Core, the first release in
      their flagship Armored Core series of mecha combat games. With the
      launch of the PlayStation 2 in 2000, FromSoftware released the
      role-playing games Eternal Ring and Evergrace. In 2003, FromSoftware
      published Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven, a stealth game that combines action and
      adventure elements. The company also released King's Field IV and
      Shadow Tower Abyss, in addition to the Lost Kingdoms series for the
      GameCube. The company also made a few games exclusive to the Xbox
      around this time, such as Murakumo: Renegade Mech Pursuit, Otogi: Myth of
      Demons, Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors, Metal Wolf Chaos, and Chromehounds In
      2005, FromSoftware would start to produce a series of licensed games based
      on the various anime properties under the banner Another Century's
      Episode. The same year, the company hosted the video game industry's
      first internship that let students experience game development through a
      game creation kit, Adventure Player, for the PlayStation Portable.
      FromSoftware underwent a stock split in 2008 before achieving breakout
      success in the 2010s, spurred by the release of Demon's Souls (2009)
      and Dark Souls (2011), the latter being the first entry in a trilogy whose
      success led to the creation of a subgenre of action role-playing games
      known as Soulslikes. These include Dark Souls II (2014), Bloodborne
      (2015), Dark Souls III (2016), Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
      (2019), and Elden Ring (2022), which have all received
      several awards and are often listed among the greatest video games of all
      time. In April 2014, Kadokawa Corporation announced its
      intention to purchase the company from former shareholder Transcosmos.
      Following other restructuring, Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki would be
      promoted to company president the following month and later given the
      title of representative director. In January 2016, FromSoftware
      established a studio in Fukuoka that focuses on creating
      computer-generated imagery (CGI) assets for their games. In August
      2022, Sixjoy Hong Kong (a subsidiary of Tencent) and Sony Interactive
      Entertainment respectively acquired 16.25% and 14.09% of FromSoftware,
      leaving 69.66% to Kadokawa. A report published by GamesIndustry.biz in
      November 2022 said that FromSoftware paid their employees at sub-standard
      rates. The company had 397 employees as of June 2023.
