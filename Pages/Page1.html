    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>
      Elden Ring is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware.
      It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by
      fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was published for PlayStation 4,
      PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 by
      FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally.
      Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to
      repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord. Elden Ring is
      presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its
      interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player
      character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden
      dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several
      types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled
      by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast
      travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game
      currency called runes. Elden Ring features an online multiplayer mode in
      which players join through cooperative play to fight bosses or engage
      player-versus-player combat. FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world
      game based on Dark Souls. Miyazaki admired Martin's previous work, and
      hoped that his contributions would produce a more accessible narrative
      than those of the company's earlier games. Martin was given unrestricted
      freedom to design the backstory while Miyazaki was lead writer for the
      in-game narrative. The developers concentrated on environmental scale,
      role-playing, and the story; the scale required the construction of
      several structures inside the open world. Elden Ring received critical
      acclaim for its open world, gameplay systems, and setting, with some
      criticism for its technical performance. It won several Game of the Year
      awards and has sold 23 million copies. A downloadable content expansion,
      Shadow of the Erdtree, is planned to be released in June 2024.

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>
      Elden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, a fictional realm over which
      several demigods rule. It was previously ruled over by the immortal Queen
      Marika, who acted as keeper of the Elden Ring, a powerful force that
      manifested itself as the physical concept of order. When Marika shattered
      the Elden Ring and disappeared, her demigod children began fighting over
      pieces of the Ring in an event called The Shattering. Each demigod has a
      shard of the Ring called a Great Rune, which corrupts them with power. In
      the game, the player character is a Tarnished, one of a group of exiles
      from the Lands Between who are summoned back after the Shattering. The
      player must traverse the realm to repair the Elden Ring and become the
      Elden Lord.

    <p>
      Early in their journey to repair the Elden Ring, the player-character
      Tarnished encounters a maiden named Melina. Because the Tarnished is
      maidenless, Melina offers to act as their maiden, granting them the
      ability to turn runes into strength and giving the Tarnished a steed named
      Torrent. In exchange, Melina requires the Tarnished to take her to the
      Erdtree, the home of the Elden Ring. Melina later takes the Tarnished to
      the Roundtable Hold, a gathering place for other Tarnished seeking to
      repair the Elden Ring. The Hold's benefactor the Two Fingers instructs the
      Tarnished to collect the Great Runes and bring them to the Erdtree, where
      they can be used to repair the Elden Ring. The Tarnished travels into the
      Lands Between, investigating its locales and defeating the demigods. After
      recovering at least two Great Runes, the Two Fingers allows them to battle
      Morgott the Grace-Given, the demigod guarding the Erdtree. The Tarnished
      defeats Morgott but finds a wall of thorns blocking the Erdtree's
      interior. Melina arrives and advises the Tarnished to find the Flame of
      Ruin, which they can use to ignite the Erdtree and destroy the thorns. The
      Tarnished is free to travel towards the Flame of Ruin or search for a way
      to harness the equally powerful Frenzied Flame. If upon obtaining the
      Flame of Ruin the Tarnished did not gain the power of the Frenzied Flame,
      Melina takes the Flame of Ruin and sacrifices herself to set alight the
      Erdtree. If the Tarnished gained the power of the Frenzied Flame, Melina
      abandons the Tarnished, forcing them to use the Frenzied Flame to set
      alight the Erdtree. While the Erdtree burns, the Tarnished is transported
      to the ruined city Farum Azula. After defeating Maliketh the Black Blade
      and using his Rune of Death to fuel the fire, the Tarnished is returned to
      the foot of the scorched Erdtree. Inside, they fight Radagon, Queen
      Marika's consort cohabitating her body, and the tree's guardian the Elden
      Beast. After both are vanquished, the Tarnished gains access to Marika's
      shattered corpse, which contains the remains of the Elden Ring. Depending
      on the Tarnished's actions during the game, six different endings can be
      achieved; these include the Tarnished becoming the Elden Lord, the Elden
      Ring being destroyed by Ranni the Witch, and the Tarnished using the
      Frenzied Flame to destroy the Lands Between.
